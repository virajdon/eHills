Welcome to eHills, the interactive eBay-clone bidding game that you can play offline anytime! 

To run this program, first open the Server folder, click the Server JAR file, and wait until the server is set up. 
Then, open the Client folder and click the Client JAR file to start bidding. 

One must place the highest bid within the time limit in order to successfully win the item. Multiple clients can be set up on one computer under different usernames. One can view the history of bids on a selected item, the history bids for that particular user themself, and the history of bids in the entire auction. There is a search feature that checks to see if there is an item and/or customer that matches the query. Whenever a user wants to complete their session, they may use the "Quit" button to do so.

Please refer to "Documentation.pdf" for further information.
